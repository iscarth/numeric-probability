This code demonstrates how many numeric functions can be converted to probability functions using integration.  
Given some S = (a, b)
and some function f(x) >= 0 on S
1)Compute normalizing constant 'c' such that when integrating over entire space 'S' the integral of c*f(c) = 1
2) (f(x) / the integral of f(x)dx )= g(x), so g(x) is no a probability density function
3) We can now integrate over a portion of 'S' to find it's probability
4) We can also find the "expected value" or mean of the distribution
